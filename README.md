# MovieRevenuePrediction

A Simple project to predict Movie revenue using Budget as its Feature. This project explains working of Linear Regression.

Regression models describe the relationship between variables by fitting a line to the observed data. Linear regression models use a straight line. Regression allows you to estimate how a dependent variable changes as the independent variable(s) change.

In this Movie Revenue is Target and Budget is Feature to Train Model.

The Goodness of Fit for this model is around 0.54 but it can be improved on adding more features. This is just for introduction to Linear Regression.
